Project Title
Job-os

————————————————————————————————————————————

What was accomplished during the week?

This week, we began to link the different pages of Job-os. After we switched to
a new design last week, we spent recent days converting the remaining pages
of the website. Most importantly, the navigation bar now allows users to
browse what we have to offer. We have early versions of:

-Home
-Review a Job
-Find a Job (placeholder while we work on MongoDB)
-Map (still very early as we have not connected it to data)

We also continued our discussion on MongoDB. After completing Assignment 3, all
members of our group now have a good understanding of how to store and manipulate
data. While working on Assignment 3, our goal was simply to push the website
as far as possible without a full Mongo implementation. We are now ready for
the next step.


What challenges and issues were faced during the week?

Bootstrap continues to be both helpful and challenging. While we have done our
best to understand the platform, it can be difficult to integrate into the
project. It remains a central part of Job-bos since design is so important to
us. We will spend the next few days preparing to teach the class about
Bootstrap!


What are the goals for next week?

Over the new week, we will finally start to add MongoDB into Job-bos. Our project
is fairly static at the moment because we have no data. But once we can
dynamically add and remove job records, it will quickly become a useful tool.
We will build a Mongo database, connect it to our project, and write the code
necessary to let users interact with Job-bos.
